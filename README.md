## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1 align="left">Julio Martins â€” Senior Engineer & Team Lead</h1>

I build high-leverage engineering teams and ship reliable software.  
Experienced in backend (Node.js/TypeScript, Java, Python), distributed systems and product delivery.  
Currently deep-diving Node.js internals to sharpen fundamentals â€” and looking for a **Developer role in Portugal** to contribute and grow.

---

### What Iâ€™m focused on (now)
- **Node.js Deep Dive**: hands-on experiments on event loop, libuv, streams, workers, error patterns
- **Team Leadership**: code quality systems (CI, reviews, architecture docs), mentoring, hiring
- **Delivering**: pragmatic designs, measurable outcomes, fewer moving parts

---

### Highlights
- Acted as **team leader**, guiding squads from zero-to-production, balancing **speed with reliability**  
- Built APIs and services with **TypeScript, Node.js, Java, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker**  
- Obsessed with **observability** (logs, metrics, traces) and clean failure modes  
- Strong communication: turning complex internals into clear, actionable decisions

### Engineering principles I run with
- **Clarity first**: small RFCs > big surprises  
- **Own the operability**: if we ship it, we monitor it  
- **Bias to simplicity**: fewer moving parts, better outcomes  
- **Make it legible**: good names, good docs, good reviews  
- **Feedback loops**: fast CI, feature flags, safe rollbacks

### Work with me
I am actively seeking a **Developer role in Portugal**, where I can contribute with strong backend expertise, Node.js fundamentals, and team leadership experience.
